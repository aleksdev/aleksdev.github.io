    <p>TritBits is an addictive puzzle game designed to train your brain. Challenge your puzzle game skills with this
      exciting game.</p>
    <p>TritBits game lets you combine puzzle blocks, build and destroy structures by creating patterns on the game
      field. Enjoy addicting brain training exercises with the power of TritBits!</p>
    <p>The rules are quite simple. You have the game field and the shape under it. You can rotate current shape. To
      place the shape drag and drop it on any empty cells on the game game field. Above the game field you can see
      current pattern. Place shapes to create patterns on the game field. To create pattern you need to fill cells that
      match pattern shape. You can combine blue blocks and green blocks to create patterns. When you create patterns
      blue blocks became green. After every move the game field fills the blocks it contains. When the green blocks are
      filled, they explode and remove the red blocks around. When the blue blocks are filled, they turn into red ones.
      When the red blocks are filled, they spawn new red blocks around. Try to avoid creation of red blocks. The game
